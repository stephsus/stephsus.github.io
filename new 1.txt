[Intro]

Oh Let me down easy. 
Let me down easy oh before you go.
Oh let me down easy. 
Let me down easy oh before you go.

G                     D
Ba Ba Ba Ba da dup Ba Ba Ba
Em                    Bm
dup Ba Ba Ba da dup Ba dup Ba
C                D
Dup Ba Ba ba da dup Ba Ba Ba
G               D
Dub Ba Ba ba da dup Ba Ba Ba

[Verse]

G                                  D
Night and day I've been doing the math

   Em                                    Bm
To calculate where we wandered off track

       C               D             G    D
But I know that this love was never easy

      G                               D
But something's fading inside of your heart

      Em                           Bm
So Youre crusading to tear us apart
  
           C            D                Em      Bm       
But it's clear now, I know you're gonna leave me

         C            D                G                        
So disappear now, I won't get in your way

[Chorus]

G     D           Em           
Ohh, let me down easy. 

Bm          C    D             G     D
Let me down easy oh before you go

G     D           Em
Ohh, let me down easy. 

Bm           C   D             G    D
Let me down easy oh before you go

[Verse]

G                      D           Em  
How do I begin to convince you to love me

                          Bm      C
When you're a star in the sky up above me

       D               G       D
And Im too far down below?
              
       G                      D 
Your heavy heart's taken its toll

        Em                               Bm
You've lost all the magic inside of your soul

    C               D                G
So sell me a lie before you hit the road

[Chorus](2x)

G   D           Em
Oh let me down easy. 

Bm          C   D              G   G7
Let me down easy oh before you go   oh yeah

[Bridge]

         C                C7                 G  
Cause I know You'd rather run than stay and try
                 G7
(Ba Ba Ba Ba da dup Ba Ba Ba)
          C                  C7        G 
Cause I know it's that much easier to say goodbye
                 G7
(Ba Ba Ba Ba da dup Ba Ba Ba)
        C                  C7
And I know that if you've made your mind
Bm                         Em
Take what you want and get out of my life
     D#                             
But can you do this one last thing
      D (fade out)
and leave me with my pride

[Chorus]

G     D           Em           
Ohh, let me down easy. 

Bm          C    D             G     D
Let me down easy oh before you go

G     D           Em
Ohh, let me down easy. 

Bm           C   D             G    D
Let me down easy oh before you go


[Verse]

G                                  D
Night and day I've been doing the math

   Em                                    Bm

         C            D                G                        
So disappear now, I won't get in your way

Hey Dude - good tab. Just one correction. In the bridge it goes from D to Dm (not D7). D7 works ok but Dm has a better feel for mine. Cheers
